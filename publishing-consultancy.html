                  <p>We are equipped to carry out product, organizational, and financial audits. Working closely with the client’s own staff or at a discrete distance&mdash;depending on the client’s preferences&mdash;we can review strategies, tactics, and other issues relating to the business, and audit relevant internal systems and procedures. We can solicit views of key external contacts&mdash;authors, customers, and others&mdash;on their interactions with client publishers and benchmark key aspects of their programs and activities against current publishing business sector norms and those of key competitors.</p>

                  <p>Our research capabilities are extensive and flexible, and can be applied to a variety of different types of projects.</p>

                  <p>For example, for the assessment of the business outlook for a particular type of company, identifying the emerging trends in the publishing industry pertinent to its publishing program, identifying and describing the responses and new business models that other publishers active in the sector have adopted to meet new challenges, identifying key areas for growth, and so on.</p>

                  <p>Or on a smaller scale, for a range of products or even single publications for which help at a very granular level is needed: the nature of the audience, the organizations the prospective buyers belong to, the publications they read, conferences they attend, the mailing lists they will be on.</p>

                  <p>We are also experienced at planning and holding focus groups in both domestic and international settings.

                  <p>For whole company or major list projects, following the audit and research stages, we work with clients to provide an assessment of where they stand on each key front, identify areas for investment and growth, and make recommendations for changes for the future. These findings may then be worked up into business plans with detailed goals, benchmarks, budgets, and schedules.</p>

                  <p>Or on a smaller scale, for individual lists, a subset of publications, or even a single title, after researching the market and pathways to sales, we can create marketing and sales plans for implementation by the clients themselves, or by MPHC via its marketing agency wing.
